7,422590,no
8,323399,"Not very much. I'm a University professor, so I've been teaching online from home. My partner was unemployed before, so she's just staying home, especially because she has chronic illnesses. We've been preparing a bit more, but otherwise, nothing really has changed."
9,233039,Not at all

11,655352,I feel that I am able to focus more on my work better. I am not around others as much now. I am able to find and do projects at home. I can just contact everyone online now too.
12,211568,none
13,265118,"Social distancing hasn't affected me that much, because I am an introvert and I work from home and socialize online with friends. It has made it more difficult when I need to go to the grocery store somewhat, but otherwise everything is mostly the same where I am."
14,991235,
15,648345,It has been a little weird being trapped in house and when I get off work I feel like I should be doing something else. It's odd getting off from work and instantly being at home. It makes me wish I could go somewhere and do something with the extra time. I am sick of Hulu and Netflix
16,280486,"I am able to work from home so it hasn't changed much with regards to work. With regards to hanging out with friends and going to restaurants, I am simply staying home. I've ordered takeout or cooked at home for roughly 1.5 weeks now. I am self quarantining."
17,394510,it has not affected me that much
18,136208,Stay home as much as possible
19,725679,"I currently am a college student at The University of Texas at Dallas, and all of our classes got moved online for the rest of the semester, which is huge for me. While this provides some benefits, I think the social aspect of just going to school was important to me. I'm unable to go out and hang out with my friends during this time, like going to a boba shop, or just dancing or playing music with my friends. It does get pretty lonely at times, and my depression has definitely gotten worse as a result."
20,812265,"I already work remotely from home, so this has not affected me a great deal. I'm not going out to dinner at all or grocery shopping as much and I am cooking far more at home."
21,709104,I am now remotely working and working less hours.

23,823714,"The quarantine/social distancing has affected me by my having to work from home. My wife is also working from home. We stay inside our house most of the time, except when the weather is good, we take a neighborhood walk but we stay far away from other people. We wave from afar. We talk with our sons and parents on skype and via email. I communicate with coworkers with Zoom, Slack, and email. We feel confined but we are doing our part to keep ourselves and others safe."
24,425847,"I am working from home and home schooling my kids. If you think we complain about millenials, wait until these e-learning kids hit the workforce! We're screwed!"
25,920387,Not really much other than cancel some trips for hobbies that we had.
26,192146,I feel indifferent toward this.
27,386672,It's made me more nervous.
28,912787,"There's been negligible changes, since I already worked from home and basically left once a week to get groceries."
29,214585,"Have been working from home, we have many less projects going on. We have had cut hours. Have been sheltering in place as well, there are orders from our city to do that. I have been been eating worse, more junk food, more fast food. It has made me much more anxious overall."
30,624778,"Its not so much the social distancing that's affecting me, more of a 'trying to survive this economic collapse' that's causing me stress. Will I be able to afford my bills? Will I be able to buy the essentials I need?"
31,349902,The social distancing has not affected me whatsoever. I am an essential worker so I still have a full time job and am grateful for that. I still live my life the same.
32,752226,"I am definitely upset that I don't get to see some friends and family members like I am used to doing. I keep up with them via phone and social media and email. We are working together to get through this the best way possible, and we are making sure that we all share knowledge to help protect ourselves and each other."
33,105407,It really hasn't
34,230288,My work has just about stopped so my pay has gone down drastically.
35,464430,IT has not affected me....I am just waiting for it to be over it is an overreaction
36,724840,"It has made me feel anxious. I usually stay home anyway and don't like to go out an socialize much, but because I am trying to take care of legal things after the passing of my mother, I have to go out into the public and this makes me anxious."
37,111125,"stay at home as much as possible, no longer eat outside, no parties or gatherings, no visit to friends' places, fewer trip to grocery stores."
38,751275,Activities have been cancelled and I can't go out with friends
39,848928,"All of my work has moved from the classroom to online, and we don't know when we'll return. I miss my friends and family I cannot see."
40,560617,"It has affected me that I have to work from home. Now I found it little bit more harder to stay focus when I'm working. In addition, it's harder mentally because I cannot drive a hour away to visit my loved one weekly."
41,384281,It has prevented me from gathering with friends on the weekends. It has also limited my ability to get together with other family members. Working from home is weird and it's difficult to work without having other staff within feet of me. It is very difficult to collaborate ideas with other staff when needed.
42,232329,My workplace is currently closed and I am furloughed. I stay in my apartment and just watch tv or play videogames. I keep a pretty normal schedule now but when I was working my shift varied and i mostly worked grave shift.
43,565855,"I am more conscious about cleanliness. I usually go out on the weekends, but haven't left my apartment, except to walk my dog, in two weeks."
44,898282,"I am a waitress and all restaurants were shut down in my state, so I currently have no income and have a lot of anxiety about money. I am anxious about how I will pay my bills, since the end of the month is near. I feel angry at the government and I am disappointed in society and humanity. I miss having stability in my life."
45,615827,Des not make much difference except my husband is now working from home
46,588711,I've felt more anxious and more on edge. I miss seeing my family and friends in person. I'm more prone to lashing out. I'm more depressed. I'm bored with a lot of the things in my house.
47,360082,I don't get to see my family as often. The kids are stuck in the house more and they don't get to go out or hang out with family members during the day. They have a lot of pent up energy and they get in trouble more. We are more bored at home than we used to be.
48,468525,"I work at a school, so long have a place to be until the schools reopen.

I have kids myself, and I've made a conscious effort to not change our schedule while they are at home doing their school work."
49,684704,I'm now simultaneously taking care of a toddler and doing a full time job from home. It's almost unsustainably exhausting.
50,561614,"It really hasn't all that much, other than the fact that I work at home more. I already worked from home a few days a week, now I work from home 5 days a week. I am a home-body the rest of the time, so it really hasn't made a huge difference."
51,756419,I'm just more stressed out and worried. There's all this uncertainty. My job is still fine but will it continue to be? Can my roommates pay rent? Are my friends going to be okay? It's all very concerning.
52,355941,It affected my daily life and then my routine habit of my work and my family members.
53,933721,It has made me anxious but i am staying optimistic. and grateful that I have a place to live food telephone tv and internet and caring people in my life.
54,611299,I feel lonely and out of touch with everyone but I feel bad for my kids. They are the ones suffering. They miss school and their friends. I definitely miss the routine and not being in fear so much! I worry all of the time and my anxiety is thru the roof.
55,261822,i stay indoors more but besides that I still talk to friends on googlehangouts
56,741744,"I have to work from home on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, And Thursdays"
57,117773,"not much, have worked remotely from home on/off during week..though always cautious when leaving apartment from taking walk, laundry, deliveries..constant anxiety"
58,237354,not at all
59,351282,"The only thing is my day job hours has been cut until further notice. So I have so much free time these days to stay at home. However I am unable to enjoy my regular social activities before the self isolation procedure. Other than that, I am in the dark as far as when I will be going back to work. I am currently using these time stay at home to rest up, so that when life returns to normal, I am fresh and can go back to work with lots of motivation and energy."
60,956108,
61,613657,good
62,181024,"I'm now working from home which alters my schedule a decent amount. I don't have to drive into work so I wake up a little later. Not being able to socialize outside of my household or go to the gym means I workout at home and generally drink/smoke more than I normally would. Other than that it hasn't affected me too much, I'm still pretty healthy and getting work done."
63,246503,It has reduced the amount of work I have and required me to adjust how I interact with family members.
64,929721,"I have had barely any social interaction since it started, mostly communicating over text message. I feel more and more anxious. I feel antsy and I find it hard to concentrate."
65,515341,"Greetings Begin With A Hug And Kisses To The Cheeks, But That Is All Changing. Learn More! Close Contact Is As Natural As Breathing In Rwanda & Social Distancing Is Hard To Achieve. Female Focused. Empowering Women. Solutions To Poverty."
66,612951,"I lost my job, I was a dishwasher in a restaurant and they where closed down by the cities health department due to Corona Virus"
67,930406,It hasn't effected my household all that much as we do not spend much of our time socializing or in public places. Our routines are still nearly exactly the same except for when we go to the grocery we are much more cautious. We stopped going to the park and have opted for the woods instead as well.
68,277469,not really
69,601235,It has affected me in I can't leave my house and it's boring
70,259638,It's obviously mildly annoying but that's life. Sometimes you have to do things you don't feel like doing and there's generally a pandemic every 100 years or so. We're lucky we live in a day where it can be addressed seriously and with medical advancements we have compared to the past.
71,551323,"It hasn't really. I work from home and we live in a rural area, so our lives literally have not changed since social distancing has started."
72,848461,No. I am at home usually anyways.
73,680390,"I no longer have a job. I can't work so I'm currently stressed out about money and having the money I need to survive during this time of life. I miss my life, and I am just so disoriented so that makes life a little harder."
74,140536,My husband an I now both work from home during this time till our jobs say that it is safe to go back to the office. Also our kids are home from school so i am having to home school my kids while I am working. And my family does not go out for anything other then groceries once a week and then it is only my husband or I going instead of the whole family.
75,505709,"I am not much of a social person and don't usually go out a lot. So in terms of social situation that is the same. I do talk to my friends less in person but we still text. I work from home now, and am glad I can do that so I can still get a pay check. My kids are doing home school so I am a teacher along with all the other crap I do everyday. I just simply don't go out to the movies or anywhere with the kids like we used to on weekends."
76,8559281,"I am unable to work, which I am okay with. I have saved enough for emergencies like this. Other than that it has not affected me that much. I am an introvert, so I did not go out often before."
77,823686,It hasn't really affected me much since I work from home anyway.
78,686770,"I am working from home, as is my husband. My children are also home conducting virtual learning."
79,362912,"I have a job as a Table Games Dealer at a casino working night shift. Since the stay-at-home order the casino has been shut down so I am on ""normal"" hours. I do not have a job to go to so I am just staying at home. I have lost about 40% of my income since it is a tipped position and the company is only paying me 10 dollars an hour."
80,630116,it has made me stuck at home and boredom sucks.. it is hard to go out there cos of the fear of contracting the virus and its affecting me financially.
81,626665,"I have had to not go to work for the past week, I'm not sure if I'm getting paid and that has been stressful. I have had time to relax at home, though, so that helps keep my stress levels low."
82,704721,It is mentally exhausting dealing with stupid people who've lost all common sense. It's also driving me insane dealing with people in stores and other places because people are in panic mode for no reason.
83,349566,"Before the quarantine was initiated, I worked on average 9 hours a week. After the quarantined was set, my client's school was closed down and now I must work on average 30 hours a week in order to care for him while his parents are at work. Financially, it has improved because I'm working three times more hours than I usually am. However, it has mentally and physically drained me from working so many hours on short notice."
84,304384,It affected a lot to me based on my work
85,716142,"From a positive perspective, I get to work more often from home and get to see the family more. At the same time, it's been negative in that many people are impacted by this pandemic and the constant stream of news have been very dire."
86,440034,"It hasn't affected me much, I don't go out very often. I just am buying groceries less frequently."
87,981275,Not too much. I am just more restricted and cannot go out as freely as I could before.
88,633607,"Yes, everyone is stuck at home working or doing school work"
89,975458,"The quarantine just relieves a little bit of stress from work. But my sleep is staying the same. I would like to go out more on the weekend, but I unfortunately can't"
90,561838,"It has not really affected me because before now , i do not like talking to people and going out except on special occasions or going to work"
91,157757,"I have lost my job, hopefully temporarily. I have enjoyed my time with my family and with God."
92,510108,"Honestly has no affect other than the kids being home. Because kids are home I'm awake a bit longer during the day whereas, when they're in school I sleep/nap during the day."
93,977616,"I used to live near my boyfriend in another city. Now I'm visiting my parents. I'm hesitant to go back to my boyfriend because he is still working and I don't want to bring anything back home if I visit my parents again. Also, I just graduated from nursing school and I can't take the NCLEX to be licensed because nobody is going to proctor the test right now. I can't start any job as soon as I would like."
94,722610,i have been away from people and it suck
95,723511,"Honestly, it's affected me very little. I work from home, don't go out often, and am not incredibly social to begin with, so this is business as usual for me. The only difference is that my husband is home. He's a teaching assistant, working from home, and fortunately is getting paid (albeit less because he's not doing his usual overtime.) If anything, the stay at home order has simply given me help with the housework, and the op to spend more time having fun with my husband. I'm one of the lucky ones."
96,288102,I work from home now. I have been under stress. I worry about my health
97,952984,I have been off work this week because my company had to shut down. I have been at home and my anxiety has been high.
98,298635,I am always in door not having a lot to do so i spend most of my time sleeping
99,966536,It really has only made me stay more at home and eat out less often. Other than that all is the same.
100,354356,"It has changed how free I am to go about my normal errands. Since I work at home, I usually go out several days a week for grocery shopping or just to browse around and get some time away from working at the computer all day. Now, I don't go out at all except for groceries. I don't go visit friends right now either."
101,904243,It has kept the children at home. I am volunteering my time to provide daycare to a friend so she can continue working. It is hard to get the food and supplies that we need because people are hoarding and being selfish. It has made me sad to watch this chaos that surrounds our country right now.
102,561420,I am working remote so it has been a fairly drastic change. I am head of IT so I have been dealing with a lot of questions and issues with people trying to work from home and of course everyone's situation is unique compared to being in an office setting.
103,199822,I feel lonely and bored most of the time. I also feel disconnected from the world and I think I'm missing out on something.
104,793873,"it has never really affected just that my work as never been like my normals
the way i needed"
105,945915,I just get to stay home more and I'm not making any money because I am a substitute bus driver and a housekeeper.
106,136552,just stay home more than usual has not really affected me lately
107,477332,It really hasn't affected me too much. I am aware of what I need do to stay safe and aware of anything that is closed. I guess the biggest part that affects me is the grocery shopping and lack of toilet paper.
108,166113,I refuse order out because I am scared of the delivery person and even the person who packs my order having Coronavirus. So I have been cooking each night and it's been a lot of fun actually. I forgot how much I love Meatloaf. Seriously it's like the best thing ever but I never make it anymore. I forgot how great Pancakes and Eggs and Bacon for dinner can be. Also I am saving a lot of money.
109,693104,"I can tell I'm starting to feel more depressed. I've been getting groceries for my elderly mother, and I'm always worried I might be bringing in the virus to her. I also just miss being with friends in person and general interacting with people. It's also very easy to become a hypochondriac over a sneeze that I know is from an allergy."
110,334063,Social distancing has no effect on me. I know the coronavirus is being used as a fake cover to shutdown all business for the planned global financial economic collapse and change of the money system to the mark of the beast.
111,230053,My life hasn't changed all that much. I am still going to work because I can't work from home and I have an essential job. It's hard to find food or supplies.
112,751049,its been rough but im dealing with it i usually stay at home and dont go out unless its for food
113,215672,It has stopped me from going to work and other social obligations
114,875245,I work remotely now. I order food through the drive through only. I do not leave my home except for food and medication.
115,709602,"I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF FRIENDS, ANYWAY. bUT, I DID MAKE MOST ALL OF MY SOCIAL CONTACT THROUGH MY BUDDHIST ORG. AND ACTIVITIES. SO WITH THAT BEING SUSPENDED WE'VE BEEN USING ZOOM AND FACETIME TO ACTUALLY BE TOGETHER. IT DEF HELPS. I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF MTURK AND PROLIFIC SURVEY WORK -- MORE THAN USUAL. I TRY TO GET OUT, BUT IT'S BEEN A LITTLE ON THE COLDER SIDE HERE RECENTLY.
READING, STUDYING BUDDHISM, STREAMING, NAPPING"
116,425246,It has made me stay away from all my close friends and family which really made me upset and lonely.
117,987989,"Since I already work from home, I have to say I am little affected. Shopping is the only real noticeable difference, with long lines and/or stock shortages resulting from panic buying, but even that is improving. I am in electronic contact with as many people every day as ever, and know many people who ARE greatly affected. I provide caregiving to shut-in parents, and they too have seen little change to their day-to-day lives. It remains to be seen if things will change as the sitution evolves."
118,879316,It's been much irritation being alone without contact anybody touching anyone including children is more stressful to me.
119,798877,I do not go out as much as often now. I only go out for work and grocery shopping. I also sanitize my house and wash my hands much more often.
120,458469,My income has been reduced to half. It is difficult to get needed food and groceries.
121,970982,It has affected me too much. I am disabled and I don't get out much anyway.
122,249153,It hasn't. I can't grocery shop as normal now so I need to buy online. Some work has slowed down though.
123,711461,"I have been socially isolated for years.

You folks have finally caught on."
124,308442,"Restless, bored, worried"
125,917602,"It has not affected me too much. I usually work alone in the early morning hours and then open my shop and welcome the other employees to work around 7am. This has remained the same except our shop is to-go only now with most people calling in their order ahead of time and also paying in advance so that they just have to walk in and collect their ready-to-go order and leave.
I wish more people here were observant about keep distance in public places such as the grocery store. Luckily, I am a very well prepared person and do not have to go to the store more than once or twice in the past 3 weeks.
I have not been negatively affected by the quarantine or social distancing."
126,686617,COVID 19 AFFCETED MY NIGHBOURS
127,391845,It has made me stay further away from others
128,274418,"I work from home, and am poor, so I haven't traveled anywhere. I usually just go to the grocery store anyway, and am pretty much just living like I normally do. I live alone in a duplex, and don't have to interact with others to access my dwelling. I have neighbors but have been keeping a distance.
I work in the yard when I get bored, and still visit my family at least once a week since they have also been quarantined for the past 3 weeks, since the outbreak in Kirkland, WA. My son's office building is in Kirkland but his office closed down way before the other office's did.
The only crowded place I have been to during the last 3 weeks was to the grocery store before the stay in place was issued several weeks ago."
129,481069,some time i am satisfied . because family sutiations is occur
130,874147,"It has affected my level of being anxious. I am worried for my family. I am also very concerned about getting food and supplies for my home. When I go to the store, there is very little to purchase. It is very stressful to have to go to numerous stores to find what I need to live. Ordering from stores does not mean that you will get what you need and you have to wait a while for it. If delivery does not bring what you need, then you must go out to look for it. I am concerned about getting the virus when I go out for necessities."
131,463839,it isolated me. My kids and myself stay indoors now to avoid being affected by Covid 19
132,472295,it has reduced my whole life
133,314154,I feel bad that I can't go an visit with my mother like I used to. I work in assisted living and am around the elderly all day. I do not want to take a chance an infect my mother if I do in infected.
134,887840,"My employer decided to let a bunch of people go around the time they started the social distancing movement. I was one of them. Can't find a new job though, because nobody is hiring during this mess. So, I am now without an income and stressing over how I will pay my bills. To make matters worse, despite what the news is saying, utilities are not willing to work with me on payment arrangements during this time. So my stress is through the roof and severely impacting my sleep."
135,806329,"I can't take public transit, I can't go to the library, I can't physically go to work, I can't sell my blood plasma, I can't go to the store as often, I wash my hands way more often (about 10 or so times a day), my roommates have increased in number because of travel and housing changes, we can only find toilet paper very rarely, but we got a bidet to limit our toilet paper usage."
136,370824,"small affected of social distancing. but this rules ia really accepted. because, take it government human health care."
137,832869,I wasn't very social to begin with so social distancing hasn't altered my routines to a significant degree. I just have to be more wary of what I have available to me since I cannot go shopping as frequently as I did in the past. I also have to be more wary of my surroundings because of increased xenophobia and people blaming Asians for bringing Coronavirus to the U.S..
138,301840,"I am single and middle-aged, and I wasn't going out much before the effects of the virus came into play, so my life has not radically changed. I like to stay home and watch TV shows, YouTube videos, read, etc. I usually only visit my friends every few months, so we're only missing a few social nights. I am talking much less to people I run into, mostly just nodding."
139,653684,The social distancing has affected both negatively and positively. Negatively in that I don't get to visit and hang out with my friends and positively in that it has given me more time to spend with my family.
140,384280,"The quarantine hasn't really changed much for me. I am a stay at home mom and am an online college student so I don't really go out much anyways unless it is to the grocery store or something. My husband works at Whole Foods so he is constantly in contact with people. That is the only thing that worries me is that he will bring something home and get my 3-year-old son sick. Other than that, nothing has really changed much for me."
141,787207,iN A LOT OF WAYS WITH MY WORK IT HAS AFFECTED ME BADLY BUT HEALTH WISE IT IS A POSITIVE VIBE
142,455315,
143,119753,"I hate the lack of freedom. I feel like I might go stir-crazy, but I am keeping myself busy. I feel trapped, sort of."
144,346245,none
145,199122,I have not been out of the house in a week and I'm running low on supplies. I'm very anxious because I am high risk. I'm feeling a bit lonely.
146,841064,"I don't even know where to start. I wash my hands constantly, I am at home much more than usual, I am working from home. Certain things cannot be done because nothing is open. I was ok but I notice that I am getting more frustrated as time goes by. I am social by nature and people are becoming considerably more crabby. I am also tired of going to 100 stores just to find toilet paper. I am not sure if this is really answering your question. I guess I need to vent, besides completing this study. I hope this helps in some way. As a side note, I am very stressed out because I have quite a few friends and family members that insist that everything is fine. Things are not fine and I don't know how to go about convincing them that it isn't. I am not irrational and I am not a Covidiot, but I do believe the science."
147,577099,It has effected my income which I extremely stressful. Idk how I will pay my bills if I can't work.
148,209420,I just notice that it's strange in public or even meeting relatives because people are really confused by the risks involved. Not knowing how close to hug sometimes.
149,668708,It has made me feel down. I don't see the people I want to see and my work cares more about shareholders than employees. I also am missing out on events that I had plan such as my brothers wedding and baseball season.
150,420967,Social distancing affects the friendship and relationship of the friends and my romantic partner very by the way we have to COVID-19 so that we have to take those types of measures to control.
151,298764,I feel like I have more time on my hands to pursue hobbies and interests.
152,731861,I work from home for now and my children are home with me. It has been manageable but difficult to get things done and keep people on track and on their schedules. I am not getting as much income as I was and my husband had his hours cut back as well. Everyone is getting bored and restless.
153,868315,It hasn't had a huge impact on my life other than our family schedule. The kids are obviously home from school so we have home schooling. The upside of all of this is I feel like we have so much more family time now.
154,601375,"I only leave the house to get groceries and walk my dog late at night. Otherwise, I remain in my apartment."
155,102847,I live alone except for my dog so I am pretty use to social distancing excepting for going out and be able to be around friend. Pretty much have a pattern now of only going out as needed.

158,867146,"It just made me not go out much besides going to work, appointments, grocery shopping and only if it's necessary. Otherwise I just stay in and keep in contact with people through online or by pone. I'm doing my part to reduce the virus transmission and to keep myself safe."
159,197180,I am inside the house literally every day. I'm temporarily out of work.
160,887676,Everything has had to take a back seat. I will not spend any money unless its on groceries or gas. I have had less work but luckily I am still able to earn something. We have just stayed at home and kept away from everyone for the time being. I have also been dosing up on vitamins etc trying to keep healthy. Even though it really has been a stressful time I am very very optimistic for the future.
161,483693,"It's prevented me from being able to go to the store as needed, plus we're in quarantine at the moment so we're stuck in the house for at least another 2 weeks."
162,760533,I am on a mandatory vacation until the lockdown lifts. Luckily I have paid time off I can use but I feel for everyone who does not. Hopefully we come through this soon.
163,314640,"It has made me be weary of being in public and just more diligent with hand washing and watching out for visited older people. Other than that, I already worked from home most of the time so it is not a big deal."
164,726526,I have to wash hands more.
165,707259,It hasn't affected me all that much because I already led a pretty solitary life and worked from home. The biggest difference is that my family is at home with me more of the time.
166,361492,"I do not go out. My store is temporarily closed so I do not work for the last 5 days. My husband does not work and my kids stay home because the school is closed. It is hard to be in the house all day, and listen to this sad news. I just want a normal life. I FEEL STRESSED AND SCARED MORE THAN USUAL"
167,724298,"I work from home, and there are only 65 confirmed cases in my state, and none in my city or county, so it has not affected me in any way whatsoever (at least not yet)."
168,383997,
169,375544,"I find it very interesting how the pandemic has affected me. I am currently on medication and treatment for COPD, Gastroparesis, and hypothyroidism. Since getting sick my activity level has been much less and I rarely leave my house due to fear of getting sick. After hearing that I do not need to leave my house I want to very much so. I chalk it up to the difference of it being my choice to stay home vs having the choice made for me. I have become almost obsessed with disinfecting my home and keeping my family as safe as I can by following the suggested guidelines given by the state and federal government."
170,712981,"Not much, except for working from home, because I am a homebody."
171,846789,I was going to schedule my road test to get my license but the dmv is not doing road tests for a while so I cant get my license to get a better job.
172,581997,"I am self-employed. There are cases in my area and most of the local businesses have closed and my own retail store is closed, which has greatly affected my sales. The general effect on the economy has also led to no sales through my online store, which has also been detrimental to my income. The stocks I owned, which could have helped pay my bills lost a large amount of their value. I have a poor immune system and catch whatever goes around, so I have been in self-isolation for 17 days. I live in a rural area, so getting food or groceries delivered is a challenge. The only money I am making right now is through mturk. My landlord does not want to give me a break and I am not sure if I will be able to pay my rent next month or buy groceries."
173,761994,There has been no real effect. I miss being able to go get groceries when I need them.
174,391615,"mostly i am not going out as much as i used to. for example i was going to the YMCA 2x a week to swim and now i cannot do that. I would visit my best friend in the next town about every 10 days or so and now we are not doing that. but since i work at home anyways, most of my life is pretty much the same. I am still going out for my hour walk every evening as i do that alone."
175,269954,"I have not been able to participate in my usual pastimes, routines, and work."
176,534376,"I feel socially and physically far, I feel stress and worry that I will contact someone who has it, that I might spread it."

i work from home."
179,499008,I have to work from home now. I am getting work done that I did not have time to do when I was in the office working with clients. I do not go to public places and am home more often.
180,546920,"The only thing I'm seeing is a very sad failure in our society. If this is how people react to a flu virus then I'd hate to see how they're going to react when they lose their homes, their jobs, their stocks, their retirement, their future from panicking and acting like absolute babies in the face of a virus. Frankly, I think most people by now have had it, but their symptoms were nothing compared to their usual bout with the variant flu ( which the flu shot never hits right) or the even worse COLD that everyone always has hacking up all over everywhere. What I'm saying is the flu shot only works maybe 20-30 percent of the time, just ask anyone, have you had the flu shot, have you had the flu? 70 percent will answer yes.
Get back to work Americans, or you're going to not have a job to go back too.
Flu season (beginning October 2019):
Illnesses Reported: 36,000,000 - 51,000,000
Hospitalizations: 370,000 - 670,000
Deaths: 22,000 - 55,000

Illnesses Reported: 33,404
Deaths: 400"
181,521112,"I am working from home more. I am also drinking more and exercising less, only because I recently had jaw surgery and I was under orders not to exercise, but I am changing that by trying to run daily(my gym has closed)."
182,814554,"It actually hasn't affected me at all. I prefer to stay at home anyway. Our state has shut down all of the bars and restaurants, and Friday & Saturday nights, I DJ'd music. So, I have lost some of my finances by not being able to do that. I am glad though, because I don't want the virus to spread.

Some of my work, can be done from home though. I have plenty of food, TP, and cleaning supplies. I worry about my friends and family.

This too, shall pass."
183,349186,"I feel isolated and alone, and my anxiety is at an all time high. I worry about touching everything, I worry about not seeing my friends or if I see them, then potentially getting and/or spreading the virus. I worry about my mom and my boyfriend, who are both long distance and both in a risky position to contract it. I worry about going back to work, a public library, and getting sick there. I worry about who is going to take care of my dog if I get sick and have to go to the hospital. I worry about affording the hospital. I worry about finding supplies from stores that I need--I have been looking for a thermometer for 2 weeks now, and not knowing if the symptoms I have are due to allergies or COVID-19."
184,412321,it makes me mad. unnecessary. restricts our freedoms.
185,704734,"I am not able to participate in most social activities anymore as they are canceled. I am no longer able to go to the gym and get exercise outside of my house. There is now a mandated curfew here and I can also no longer go out to eat or go to places like the local museum or art shows. For me, food and toiletries are also harder to find in most stores now, as well."
186,402902,It kept me in the house much more. I dont see as many people.
187,929711,"I have not been able to attend to things in the lab that I normally do. I've been working from home. I've curtailed all social events, and been sheltering in place. Shopping trips are highly consolidated so we don't have to go out much."
188,551341,"It has made me stay at home more. I work from home so it has not really been a big inconvenience for me. I haven't been able to go out and do anything social which is kind of a bummer, but other than that I haven't really been affected by it too much, luckily."
189,247795,I barely have any food. Any money. I'm worried about paying my bills and feeding my dogs. I'm worried about eating. I'm worried about running out of food. I'm worried about not being able to buy enough food due to limitations placed on number of items. I'm worried about having to go to the grocery store once a week with infected people due to limitations placed on groceries. I'm anxious a lot. And so stressed.
190,733902,i can't contact face to face any other persons.i was only contact directly to my household members.
191,783729,It made me appreciate my friends and family more than ever. We talk more and ask about each other more. It shows that we truly care about each other and that we will support each other through this. I am grateful to have these friends.
192,221413,self quarantine mean self monitoring from some symptoms and this happen because of the pandemic virus that was originated from Chinese people
193,157111,"Social distancing has had little effect on my life. In fact, I am personally enjoying being secluded in my house, spending more time with my family, and abstaining from socially engaging with large crowds of people. I feel that Americans need to use this time to protect themselves and their loved ones. We also need to take the opportunity to use this time to remember what's important in life. Society has become so impersonal and self-centered. We are a nation of people who are less concerned about the welfare of our fellow citizens and more about taking selfies, following social influencers, and informing people of our every move on Twitter."
194,492628,Not really that much other than I got hired at a gym and then they all shut down so I can't work there anymore. I still go out shopping and carry on as normal in my day to day activities
195,579302,No change. I am an introvert and I don't have any friends currently so I was socially distanced for years even without a virus situation.
196,196229,This affected with corona virus.....distance for all people and social network....

201,394120,yes. It's not fun to not visit anyone
202,299067,It has made me feel more lonely
203,651358,Just makes me do less stuff when I'm not working

209,501442,"Now that the new coronavirus and COVID-19, the illness it causes, are spreading among communities in the United States and other countries, phrases such as â€œsocial distancing,â€ â€œself-quarantineâ€ and â€œflattening the curveâ€ are showing up in the media."

214,410907,It affects my regular activities. Such as conversation with others. And It heavily affects my job. I complete my office work in my home. I couldn't contact with every one. It restricts my perception towards others.
215,770897,It's important to protect each other but can be boring and frustrating at times.
216,341246,"It has somehow affected me positively in terms of stress reduction and relaxation. I'm at home all day, so I have less work to worry about. It has made me take the time to observe and/or focus on other aspects of my life which I might have ordinarily not have time for."
217,484415,I haven't been with my friends or anybody except my parents. I value the freedom of mobility more than I used to. I plan my grocery shopping better. I realize more that social media can bring joy from online communications.
218,659686,takes more time to clean myself and everything i touch. not talking to people as much in store. stocking up on things and going to store more to see if they got things in that they are out of
219,873644,IT WAS REALLY BAD DISEASE
220,678634,I have this constant feeling of uncertainty. I am most distressed by the fact that I can't distinguish between what's real and what's sensational BS. This brings me a lot of stress.
221,741359,Social distancing has made me stress everyday due to the thought of getting my hands dirty somewhere in public and then catching the virus. I am more alert and aware of my surroundings and what I do. I clean more and I use more chemical cleaner on a daily basis now. I get angry at people that don't social distant themselves in public. I am more worried of the world falling apart due to the virus. I sleep normally but my dreams have been bothersome that some nights I dream of the virus.
222,318518,More planing for the family and food/supplies. I still work away from home so I have minimized my drive to to and from only. Only 10 out of 100 allow in my office so it is very lonely. No social stuff. Really miss sports.

224,388934,VERY MUCH
225,472494,NOTHING
226,146595,"I have lessened unnecessary trips such as going to retail stores and places in my community. I strategically distance myself from people when I am in grocery stores and in other public spaces. I have been furloughed from work, so I am no longer leaving home for work shifts 6 days a week. Our governor has placed a ""safer at home"" order in our state, so all non essential places in our state have closed and we are advised to stay home unless absolutely necessary."

232,316106,It really hasnt affected me that much because i mostly work from home and i am an introverted person so i dont really go out of the house that much anyways. It has caused me a little stress because im not sure what will happen to the economy. My kids have been staying home from school and i had to teach them a few lessons but that wasnt too hard

237,470499,Work changed to a rotation of work at home/work at the data center. My family can't do their normal weekly things.
238,810920,Social distancing had a great effect on each and everyone starting from the poor to the rich people . It affected me a lot as i cannot complete my tasks and work responsibilities. It reduced my confidence level and hope.
239,670593,I hasn't affected me that much other than I worry about my parents or children getting the virus.
240,367382,I feel that this has just been blown out of proportion. I don't like social distancing for that reason. It has affected me in the sense that there is nothing on the shelves at the grocery store and my income has significantly decreased. Lets just get back to being how we were.
241,253046,I left my university and I am now spending time with my family. I am worried about supplies and food but I am grateful to have this extra time with my siblings.

247,187712,Nothing
248,266404,"It's a mixed reaction because I am still required to go to work. The rest of my family is not and they stay home (spouse and children). While I believe social distancing they practice keeps them safe, I am worried about me having to go to work that it exposes them to a risk."
249,848597,"I feel tired because I recently had a baby and I have to wake up to feed the baby once or twice early in the morning which disturbs my sleep. My baby wakes up between 6-7 like a clock work so I also wake up at that time. Between Morning till evening around 9 till by baby goes to sleep I cannot sleep or take rest. Also because I am a working mom I have to manage everything a baby, WFH and other day to day activities like cooking washing clothes and doing dishes etc. My husband is also very busy and tries to help me but I have to handle everything mostly. All this makes me tired and I have around 5-6 cups of coffee a day. Because of social distancing we dont go out much and its gets boring during weekends. We are managing."

257,768158,I work from home therefore more of the work has been placed on me because my coworkers aren't adapt at working in remote positions. I've been wanting to go outside to destress and walk but now I can't do that. It's annoying. I feel like my entire life has been put on pause.
258,564814,"I've had to start working from home 100% which has been a nice change of pace even if my job responsibilities and duties have not changed. The hard part is that while I'm working from home full time, my toddler is also at home with us and not attending her preschool. This means that I have to find ways to entertain my child without going out and doing the usual things we're used to doing while also working and making sure I'm meeting my job duties. The housework is more than before since we're home all day and eating at home and making more messes. Obtaining household essentials is more difficult due to stores lacking inventory and stock."
259,531418,I usually interact with older and elderly people including my parents whom I do not want to bring harm to. I have parents that are getting older and it worries me and makes me sad to think how vulnerable they are. I will be avoiding public places and gatherings of people.

260,893281,i feel lonely and sad.
261,377753,"I just feel more lonely. My partner is quarantined out of the country, so I have to be at home alone. It's not the worst thing, though, as long as I don't get sick. I have instruments and work and lots of things to do, honestly."
262,298548,It has restricted my movement. It has affected the economy e.g increase in price of goods. It has made me to be extra careful.
263,292572,"The main thing that social distancing has affected me are the following:

1. Checking on and shopping for my elderly parents, ages 89 and 91, more
frequently.
2. Reassuring my parents and answering a lot of questions.
3. Cleaning and disinfecting my home daily, including bathroom, kitchen
counter
tops, cabinet handles, door knobs, and light switches.
4. Wiping items I bring into my home, such as grocery items, with disinfectant
wipes.
6. Remove clothes that I wear out in public and place them in the washer as
soon as I get home.
5. Washing my hands more.
6. Talking to and FaceTiming with my family and those I care about more
frequently.
7. Talking to my neighbors more."
264,189742,Working from home instead of going to office. Staying isolated. Overall no major change.
265,484206,It hasn't because I still have to go to work everyday given that I work in health care.
266,836080,"My internet usage has skyrocketed, I feel unhealthy, am eating a lot and not doing much exercising. I miss going out with friends, am always on the lookout, worrying has become a problem, I don't trust strangers."

270,381762,"Well, I'm a lot more stressed about getting sick. Both my mental and physical health was in bad shape before, but I'm even more stressed out due to the virus. Every day I turn on the news or get on social media, the virus looks like it's getting much worst. I constantly worry that we might not recover from this at all."
271,826351,Quarantine completely changed my schedule.
272,417299,"Less trips to stores, regular church meetings. Taking care of family member out of the house."
273,938957,"It doesn't affect me personally, as I work from home generally. It's stopped me from grocery store runs throughout the week, however. The major affects to me would be others in my home. I'm doing okay with this social distancing, actually!"
274,940096,I cannot go to church or exercise classes. I tried to do exercise on the floor and hurt my back. I now have to spend more money for health care to correct my back with a chiropractor. I have to buy more food to make sure I can continue to eat healthy. I only talk to my friends through text and not in person. I see my family less and use text for them also.

Today is the first day it;'s been nice outside so we have encouraged the kids to go outside and play, which they are doing now...so hopefully that will help then burn off some of our energy. We have had quite a few 'family meetings' to discuss concerns about being so close in a smaller house and what is expected and needed from everyone. Overall we are doing okay and are just thankful we have food in the house. I don't miss going out in public because I definitely want everyone to stay home right now so we are not going out unless it is absolutely unavoidable...like curbside pickup of household items."
277,609370,I am temporarily out of work as a substitute teacher and I spend all my day inside with my partner. I feel like I have no sense of direction. I occasionally get to take walks but other than that do not have much structure to the day.
278,522222,"it was difficult to adapt in the beginning, but the benefits and hygiene made us to persevere and make it a practice. As said on TV - prevention is better than cure, we are living bby these words"
279,701185,Far more time at home and more work responsibilities. More time with family.
280,234455,"I am worried, depressed and scared to death, not only of the virus, but how will I eat, keep my lights on, etc. Because of my job type I don't qualify for unemployment and I can't get the food-stamp place to answer the phone. I feel lost and I worry about my elderly mom catching the virus."
281,421602,It makes me not been able to visit family members.

285,658993,"I have anxiety palpitations constantly. I'm planning the deaths of my parents. I cry often about this because it send me into shakes. I have no one to hug, or to lean on. I worry I wont have supplies to sustain. I've planned what I'd do if I had to start living off of the land. I have thoughts constantly running through my mind but none are of hope. I have major fear and anger. I feel utterly hopeless."

289,994304,"Well my wife was laid off, so there's that. Our daughter's school is closed, so there's that. And I manage a hotel restaurant that is currently closed. They are keeping me on to manage upgrade projects and so forth one to two days, and they are letting me work from home three to four days though there honestly isn't a lot I can do from there. I'm worried for my wife's well being as she is distraught, which is also affecting our daughter. We used to go out all the time, to restaurants, movies, concerts, sporting events, etc. Now obviously we can do none of those things. It's only been a little over a week and it feels like two months. I don't agree with Trump on many things, but I am wondering if his comment about the cure being more costly than the disease might be somewhat accurate."

291,122027,little bit
292,899898,It has caused me to work from home and keep awkward hours. I miss allot of overtime as a result. I don't go out now and do so only to get groceries.
293,626843,"It hasn't really affected me too much since I primarily work at home and don't go out anyway in general. The only difference is my mom being home (who works in an office) and having her around more often, which is nice."
294,416426,I feel closer to my family
295,638238,"It has been somewhat stressful because I work in a hospital, albeit in a lab. It is hard having to stay at home all the time otherwise, but I am strengthened because I KNOW it is important."

297,374468,"A little bit, but it hasn't affected my ability to do my job. I don't talk to my friends as much nor can I talk to people when I go out. I don't want to risk getting sick."
298,671856,All is well.
299,810113,I have to stay home all the time
300,960405,"It hasn't really at all. When I'm out of work waiting for the next job to start, I usually stay home and conserve my money. Basically what I'm doing now."
301,523754,social distance is very useful to product for me
302,320283,I don't leave the house. Can I go gramma?
303,724227,It hasn't affected me much. My state hasn't had as many cases as others have. Life has been mostly the same besides me being more careful when out in public and around other people.
304,612671,"I am a stay at home mom with young children so my lifestyle really hasn't been affected all that much. The only difference is that I've been keeping them home and letting my husband do the grocery shopping. He's terrible at it but since he already has to go to work everyday anyway, we're making sure only one person is going out of the house at a time to reduce the risk of contracting the virus. I'm a little stir crazy as I do enjoy getting out of the house to grocery shop and run errands. Though it is making me anxious that I cannot find certain groceries I need and am running out of."
305,938940,"I was working, but my agency decided to put a hold on the project I was working on, so now I am only MTurking from home. I cannot do my other job from home. As it was contract, I have no paid time, so it has affected me quite a bit. I am looking for another position, but only want remote work and a remote interview, as I have had recent health problems and am probably at a higher risk for COVID than some people. I'm quite concerned about my family as well, as we can't visit."

311,681297,"Well, I have some papers that I need to print out. The library which I use the printer at is shut down. Pretty much everything in my small town is shut down until April 10th. Besides essential shops, such as grocery stores."
312,380143,"I'm still working, but from home. So it's been a bit stressful getting everything set up. The kids are home from school, so keeping them on track has been a bit stressful as well. I am mostly worried about my husband, he's an essential worker at at nuclear plant, and they're going to be sequestered on-site starting soon...so I worry that some dumb coworker is going to end up sequestered without symptoms, then spreading it to everyone. Husband uses a cpap, so that concerns me as well. I'd feel better if we could all just stay home, AND if it wasn't affecting our income. (Basically, the US's response to this has been shit, and is honestly quite abusive to citizens. They're screwing us over right and left, and basically saying, 'and what are ya gonna do about it, huh? You've got nowhere to go' - just as an abuser does. So yeah, that's only elevating my stress level, and everyone else's as well, I'm sure.)

But social distancing in general? BRING IT ON. I'm an introvert, and I'd be happy as a clam if people stayed the hell away from me on a regular basis. :-)"
313,161692,I've had to close my office which has resulted in a loss of income. I'm very stressed over this which is causing me to be very irritable with my family.
314,637050,"As a student, I have been sent home from campus which is making it difficult to work as most of my classes require me to work in the laboratory, which is rather difficult for me to do online. As I go home, it is difficult to get along with my relatives who I have to stay with in isolation and I cannot work due to the change in my classes being online in addition to the food industry being shuttered quite a bit more than usual. I am also isolated at home since I have an autoimmune condition and am medicated to have a suppressed immune system."
315,928169,I miss my friends and co-workers. I do not like isolation. I miss the structure of a routine by going to work as opposed to remote work.
316,298042,"The WFH hasn't been an issue since I tend to work from home anyway when I am not traveling (which is about 20% travel throughout the year). However, I am much more active and social after work than I am now. That has been an adjustment. Also I stay up later because I feel like in general things have slowed down so much that if I'm not at my desk right at a certain hour it probably doesn't matter much unless I have scheduled meetings."
317,509059,Hasn't affected me much as I'm usually at home anyways. It is annoying when I go grocery shopping and things I need to buy aren't available because it sold out.
318,451281,I work from home so work hasnt really changed much. I have not met my friends and have been social distancing for three weeks. I miss hanging out with them.
319,660855,No very much. I work in public health so IÂ´m close to the front line everyday working on solutions.
320,947504,"The only real effects it's had on me is because of other people overreacting. You can't do anything without hearing about it, and EVERYONE wants to tell you how they're reacting, whether they have any actual information or not and whether or not you care. I mean, knowing what sanitation measures you're taking is great if you run a business I physically go to and I need to know, but it's annoying when I have to sit through a two-or-three minute spiel from my bank, which I only ever use online or on the phone. Maybe make that stuff optional, so people who are worried can be reassured but people who just want to check their balance can go ahead and do that?

Even businesses that as far as I know don't have ANY in-person customers, like the website where my cat's microchip info is stored, have to send out emails to all their customers with the same empty platitudes about ""uncertainty"" and ""serving our customers"". Which is the other thing that annoys me. Most of the emails I get and the recorded spiels I listen to don't actually SAY anything. ""People are scared."" I know! ""These are uncertain times."" To the extent that that even means anything, again, I know! ""We are doing our best to serve our customers."" I assumed you were, being a business and all! Go into details, describe what's happening that's DIFFERENT from every other business on earth, or leave me alone!

The other major effect, also caused entirely by people overreacting, is the fact that I'm down to my last roll of toilet paper. What the hell is it with people hoarding toilet paper??

The change in my sleep schedule is more in spite of the virus than because of it. I used to get up at 10 for a Skype meeting with my boss, but he's constantly overbooked and acts like I'm being unreasonable for expecting him to show up for meetings HE scheduled and HE wants to have. After he blew me off five times in a row, including three in the same day because he kept rescheduling and then not even bothering to text, I put my foot down and we rescheduled the morning meetings for evenings when he's less busy. Ironically, if I'd put up with it another week until the quarantine, the problem might have gone away on its own - he's much less busy now and his itty-bitty brain sometimes actually remembers what few meetings he has left.

Social distancing has had virtually no effect on me because I'm already a hermit. If COVID-19 mutates to the point where it can be passed through cats, then I'll be in trouble, but I was already avoiding humans as much as I could."
321,471532,"I have had a much more demanding work schedule. Because everything has changed I know have to visit different retail stores to manage different sales teams. This means I have to commute much more when I'm out in the field.

When I'm not doing that then I have to work from home and attend at least double the managerial sales calls meetings. Managers are being asked to do much more at home to compensate for loss of in-store customer traffic.

I also have to spend more time with my spouse. I am at home more now and she is not going to attend to social activities. This means that when I can I also have to attend to her needs. I am much busier than I was before social distancing affected me."

I work for two doctors as a nanny and have no PPE even though they're treating 10 positive patients currently. My pay has been substantially decreased, even though my risk is so high. I'm also being treated like crap due to them being overworked and overstressed, as well as my performance taking a nosedive with how I'm being treated and how much more work *that has NOTHING to do with caring for the kids* is being thrown on me and how ungrateful/unappreciative & critical they are."

Also when i have to grocery shop, I have to wake up early in the morning because that is when things are mostly stocked at the store. I've picked up a bad habit of eating when I am bored and I'm trying to control it. For work wise, my daily pay rate has gone down due to not having as many clients."

335,800180,"It has meant staying in my house as much as possible. It has meant working from home, which in some ways is less stressful, since I do not have to drive 50 minutes each way to work. It has meant not spending time with friends and family, which I usually do once a week in normal times. It means being careful when I do go out, to not be near anyone if I can avoid it. It also means not having the normal social contacts at work that I usually have."
336,273056,Since schools are closed my children are home during the day now. I work from home so this has made it far more difficult to actually get work done during the day. As I get less work done my income has begun to drop.

338,599516,"Yes, I don't have to spend 3 hours in California traffic anymore so I am much less stressed out every day. The downside is that both of my parents are high risk but they won't stay inside so they're causing me stress now."

We aren't able to ship any items out because we are not an essential business and can't be open, so the gallery will be losing money."

I'm still working, but my free time is a lot more free these days. I also have had to rethink and postpone many plans for travel in the coming months. Just a whole lot of uncertainty at the moment and that makes it hard to find a normal balance to daily life."

I am on day 9 of shelter in place. The most annoying thing is planning for shopping and hoping that the items you need will be available because SOME people stockpile, which I think is very rude and unAmerican. I do feel lucky though because my Town has a great volunteer program they've put in place to help seniors with shopping so we don't have to go out, plus my neighbors are wonderful and always let each other know when they making a store run. The social distancing is good and when I do go out I absolutely am careful to keep it. My daughter tells me that they've placed tape on the floor in many stores now as a reminder."

Many of these events are with large groups of people & involve close contact so I have no idea if they will even occur at the rescheduled time. As I work from home & do very little socializing in my regular life I greatly look forward to these events.

But the neighbors that we do have , we do not see anymore at this point and time. They are mostly older couples and we want to keep them safe.

I only leave my house about once a day to go for an isolated walk, or about once a week to the grocery store. I was unemployed before this, so the main difference is not going to the gym and not seeing friends. I feel like I am missing human contact.

379,398671,"Isolate isolates and limits the development of individuals who have been presented to an infectious ailment to whether they become wiped out. It endures sufficiently long to guarantee the individual has not gotten an irresistible sickness. Social separating is an approach to shield individuals from associating intently or as often as possible enough to spread an irresistible ailment. Schools and other get-together places, for example, cinemas may close,and games and strict administrations might be dropped. Think about the genuine danger of damage to yourself as well as other people around you. The open impression of hazard during a circumstance, for example, an irresistible malady flare-up is regularly erroneous. Media inclusion may make the feeling that individuals are in impending peril when actually the hazard for disease might be low."

382,966333,"I am used to social distancing. I have been doing it for years for a few different reasons. Honestly, I do not know why people have not practiced this sooner. I am concerned for others who are not practicing it as well, and some of it is through no fault of their own because of the obligations they have. There are others I know who could be much more careful, but they don't believe there is any danger and this could effect the health of others. I find this very frustrating."

No need to watch when i last eat or drink , no reason to make sure that lunch is made, or car has full gas etc. It also makes sleep a pain cause your so bored you want to stay up en you randomly wake up but the same time your not supposed to due to the fact you still have things to do and it has gotten to the point i have seperated my laundry by color or wash versus usually i do most in 1 load cause im just that bored"
415,184793,There have no effects as of yet. I do not go to crowded places and I only go to the store for food.
416,411523,I have had to move home from my university and now live at home with my family. This is a big adjustment from what I was expecting my last semester as an undergraduate student to look like. I am still adjusting and figuring out a new routine to complete classes online.
417,261539,"it has affected me away from normal day to day activities , but it is so important to to practice social distancing for the purpose of preventing the spread of covid19"
418,767208,it has affected my social life greatly.
419,673474,"I havent been able to work, were on a 15 day lock down right now and im home schooling my two kids, theyve been out of school for almost 2 weeks."
420,559151,It had given me ample time with my kids and husband. It has made me more aware in the store when getting groceries to distance from other shoppers. The lack of food in the stores has been odd. I think I am aware of everyone when they sneeze or cough. Not being able to work is really strange. Just the overall feeling of uncertainty on how all this is going to work out. Extremely worried about my daughter who is a paramedic and ER nurse. Keeping in touch with family members over face time or skype rather than in person is odd too.
421,951142,"I and my elderly parents are all high risk, so we are on lockdown, nobody in, nobody out and when stuff gets dropped off, I wipe it down with bleach before it gets put away....I'm worried to death...no so much about the virus, but about the economic collapse that is coming because of it."
422,146326,I no longer take my dog out for walks.
423,377755,I am retired and don't drive. I started using grocery delivery about a year ago. Sometimes I have restaurant delivery. My son comes over two times a week; to take out the garbage and later to return the garbage cans to the garage. I have always talked on the phone a lot with family and friends. In general my life hasn't changed much.
424,511910,I am homeschooling my kids. My college age daughter has moved home.
425,307932,"Can't go anyplace really as stores and businesses are mostly closed and whatever essential businesses that are still open have cut hours and it's advised to not leave the house to shop wherever possible. Getting sick of just sitting in the house day in and day out and just doing work and pretty much nothing else. Nevermind the constant barrage of bad news daily, which I've taken to blocking websites during parts of the day to just get away from it."
426,869533,I miss my friends and family that don't live with me. I had to cancel travel plans. I miss going out to restaurants and the movies.
427,774664,"I work from home anyways so I haven't been too much affected by social distancing. My husband and I haven't been visiting friends lately in person but we are keeping in touch via email and phone calls. It's still cold here where we live so this time of year we don't do much socializing anyways since we don't go to bars. If this pandemic situation goes on into May and June, we will become more affected by not socializing with friends and family."
428,864152,It has affected me by causing fear and stress. I am 66 and high risk and I am afraid to go to the store for necessities.
429,392422,"I am working from home, so I don't have to get up as early to drive to work, which is nice. I can work easily from home, as I spend a lot of time on phone calls even when I'm in my office. I've saved quite a bit of money because my husband and I are eating at home. He's been in charge of getting groceries and never comes back with exactly what I ask for because it's nearly impossible to find chicken and some other meats, but I'm making do. He and I have both lost a bit of weight because we aren't eating out. I'm working out more, too, which is great - I gain about an hour and a half not driving. We haven't been socializing with others, of course, but we live on a cul de sac and occassionally talk to neighbors while everyone is in their yard. My husband in a real estate agent and can't work right now, so we can pay our bills but money is tight, particularly with the market going down so much. We don't want to pull money out given it's bound to go up."
430,906448,"I work much less, I sleep more, I stay at home more, I worry about my mom more, I play video games and watch tv more, I exercise more."
431,407183,I just feel worried all of the time because of this. I'm to the point that I struggle to get through each day. It has been a nightmare.
432,600330,not affected me. Still need to do my job as fire lieutenant
433,570118,"I AM WORKING OUT OF MY HOME AS IS MY HUSBAND. WE ARE FOLLOWING THE GUIDLINES CLOSELY AND ONLY GO OUT TO THE GROCERY STORE ONCE DRUING THE WEEK. WE WALK IN A PARK AND KEEP 6 FEET AWAY FROM OTHERS OUT WALKING. IT IS GETTING OLD BUT WE FIND WAYS TO KEEP OURSELVES DURING THE DAY ON WORK RELATED ACTIVITY AND AT NIGHT PLAY GAMES, READ, WATCH TV, CALL FRIENDS AND FAMILY."
434,723315,I can not go to the store or any where else for that matter/ states on total lock down so we are confined to the house.
435,468085,"I'm retired so it really hasn't affected me much, although staying at home all the time gets a little boring. The only time we leave the house is for groceries 1 time a week and only 1 of us goes. We switch off. We've been doing this for 2 1/2 weeks already."
436,199043,"Have to constantly be aware how close you are to people, can't go to a friend's house and just hang out and talk, can't hug my daughter's or grandkids, can't go to the grocery shopping without worrying about getting sick. Curfew in our county, can't go out past 10pm or out before 6. All stores close around 7. Parks are closed so can't take walks with my dogs."
437,743519,I am required to work at home for my job and I take care of my 2 sons at home now since their school and daycare were closed. My part-time job closed so I don't have the additional income. I cannot take my sons to their school or sports events. Several of my appointments were cancelled. We no longer go out to eat.
438,460713,"It has put me a bit more on edge, especially since I live with 2 diabetics, I would hate if I was the one to get them sick, so I stay in like we are supposed to."
439,484529,It has affected me in regards to constantly going to the market for items that everyone hoarded. Therefore I am risking exposure to the virus because I need food and paper products.
440,154454,Activities curtailed. More care needs to be taken when among others. Otherwise fine.
441,192191,i cant go where id like to i enjoy going out doors and playing sports and working on projects
442,434324,"I can't find a place for out next meetup. I am the VP of the KY Proud Boys. It's gonna have to be at a park or something. All bars, restaurants are closed on the inside. Also we close earlier at work. I still work the same hours though."
443,364997,"It hasn't affected me too much at all because recently I've had few social contacts and mostly stayed at home during my spare time. I guess I'm a little less inclined to go to the store & shop and stuff, that's about it, for now."
444,553525,"it has been difficult for me to go outside the house now. i have not been able to meet with my friends, some family members and co workers"
445,321320,not much really - I still go to work everyday and come home. the only difference is that we only shop once a week now and get what we can for the coming week. we stay home for the most part outside of work.
446,822318,"It hasn't. I'm already a recluse due to my medical condition - I rarely even leave my house except for medical appointments. I can go many days without seeing, hearing, or getting anywhere close to another human."
447,282031,Mostly it's made things more frustrating and upsetting for me. It makes me feel much more like something is real and is about to affect me. It makes me worried and bored. I've gotten too focused on watching the news since I have little else to do which just frustrates me even more. I would just like this whole thing to be over.
448,414913,"I am really unaffected, my family is home and safe, we have enough supplies. We used to go shopping or dining out but we don't anymore"
449,793097,It hasn't really affected me much. I'm a big introvert and usually stayed home and to myself most times. Th eonly thing that changed is my wife usually is the social butterfly and her being cooped in the house is driving her insane.
450,908768,The quarantine has not affected me too much. I just practice social distancing as much as possible.
451,931137,it makes no difference at all.
452,201649,I am at home with my two grandchildren. Normally they would go to school and I would go to work. I have not left my property in two weeks. I have seen no one except my children and grandchildren who also live on the property.
453,955313,"It hasn't affected me that much. I already worked from home before the epidemic took hold, and I rarely left the house anyway. I have a lot of social anxiety, so I generally avoided people and going places already. I had planned on visiting my mom last week, but I decided not to, to avoid possibly spreading anything to her."
454,919405,I have to work from home every day now. I no longer go outside for anything except to do laundry. When I go outside I do my best to avoid any people and practice social distancing. I wash my hands frequently.
455,765013,"I'm a Dental Hygienist and all offices are closed in my state in order to help prevent the spread of the virus. I work in two offices, in one office my boss has me come in alone on Mondays to do administrative work. I just started working in my second office a few weeks ago. Because of my situation I am not eligible for unemployment. So aside from being paid for 3 hours on Mondays and MTurk I have no income currently. I'm trying to not leave the house unless absolutely necessary, especially since I have Asthma so I'm at a bit of a greater risk of getting the virus and my area is a hot zone for the virus. Thankfully I have a wonderful husband and pets so I am not lonely. I'm able to talk to people online and by phone so I don't feel isolated. I just really miss working. It just all feels so surreal."
456,675868,Not much. I didn't go many places to begin with except take my kids to school daily and run errands on Fridays. I do miss being able to go places on the weekends with my family whether its to a museum or even just the library. I know its the right thing to do though to help my state.
457,979343,"Other than being stuck in the house, it hasn't really affected me. I still work from home for 8-9 hours per day. I still spend most of my time with my wife and kids. I don't get to see my friends and family, but we've been talking to them through video chats to stay in touch."
458,281096,I'm incredibly stressed out. Our governor has enacted many closures and we are doing better than most states. Not having my quiet time during the day when my child is normally at school is stressful. We are practicing social distancing but some neighbors are not and it's stressful explaining to my son why he can't be out when those children are.
459,364786,"I have less contact with people, friends, and family
I go out less
I stay home more
I am more careful about hand washing and sanitation
I feel a bit more isolated and stressed out, but mostly am doing fine"
460,588536,My mom started having symptoms earlier this week. I came home to take care of her. I have to do everything around the house and take care of her since she is isolated in her room while we await the test results. I will not be going anywhere as I might have coronavirus too. I miss seeing my boyfriend and friends but we need to stay apart until this is over.
461,532753,Not too much except in the area of shopping for personal needs. I was already a bit of a hermit. I dislike large crowds and would be perfectly happy working as a lighthouse keeper or living in an isolated cave/cabin in the woods as long as I had broadband internet.
462,898140,
463,674864,"Since I'm a hermit anyway, the sheltering in place order hasn't really affected me all that much since it's what I typically do. When I do have to go out in public, I make sure I stay at least six feet away from other people and I make sure to wash my hands thoroughly when I first get in a store and last thing before leaving."
464,866078,I get lonely and bored. I am a social person and it has been difficult.
465,244612,I'm mostly bored.
466,259408,My kids are out of school for the rest of the year and many other things.
467,308920,"I am on furlough, so no work interactions. I have self quarantined in 2 houses, mine and my girlfriends. I ride my bike daily for exercise which allows easy social distancing. Unemployment will keep me financially stable so that is not of concern."
468,810726,"I don't go any where I stay ,people call to see if I need anything when they go out.I live in a rural area , where it is mostly farmers ,So we just don't get out .I stay on the farm and take care of it now , I have been working from home for employee , so I do stay busy"
469,186510,"Very little. I have been working at home and acting as my wife's caregiver for the last 4 years, so there is really not much in the stay at home orders and other things around COVID-19 that is unusual for us. The only differences I've seen so far is that there's much less traffic, and some items have been in short supply in the stores.

The care I provide my wife is on a four-hour schedule so our times for those events have not changed. We get up and go to bed at the same times and keep the same daily regimen. My work is largely the same - there was a surge in activity as we made changes last week but things are now quieting down.

I feel a bit of anxiety about the quarantine, just because of the relentless bombardment of news about it. Whenever possible I avoid a lot of news coverage, but my wife is addicted to it."
470,128022,"I miss my friends a lot. I feel a bit more isolated. I miss my job and the income. My husband is still working, but under more stress. I worry about my family becoming ill. I have had more time with my children and more time to clean and do things around my home and yard."
471,546327,"I have all of my kids at home full time now so it is stressful. My husband works in an essential job function, so he is still going to work. Our schedule is off because we don't have certain places or times that we have to be places."
472,281484,I work remotely from home. Work hours hasn't changed. Only the location. I interact less with the team I manage due to not being at the same location. I only go out for grocery but I find other means to occupy my free time. I don't necessarily feel bored or restless although I do miss spending time with my family and friends.
473,569155,I'm working remotely from home but my work is a lot slower due to technological issues. I feel cramped and irritable. I don't go out and socialize anymore and I'm starting to feel irritated texting people.
474,884694,I have to work from home. Thatâ€™s the only way that I have been affected by this.
475,993365,"The quarantine has affected my job and social life. I am now currently working from home, whereas before I was in an office. I currently do not have much of a social life as I am at home almost always, except to go out to purchase necessary items. I feel less happier and more worried than before. I feel great uncertainty as to when this entire ordeal would be over, and the country and the rest of the world will go back to the way things were before. I am more worried now than at the beginning, and I feel the situation is more severe than I had previously believed."
476,535782,Not much- we already worked from home and homeschool our kids. My daughter was in preschool one day a week and now we don't go to that but that's not that big of a change; barely noticeable. When my husband and I go on a date we sit in the car in the parking lot instead of going in.
477,340960,"My son's school is cancelled. I'm a single parent so he and I are isolated/social distancing at home together.
As of now, I'm not working. We're trying to figure out a way to work from home but, I'm not hopeful that will happen.
I'm worried about money and how long this situation will last"
478,672135,"I go out a lot less, I only go out for work or when I need groceries. I can no longer go out to the stores and shop.
I am sleeping less, it takes me more time to fall asleep, I wake up often during the night and it takes me a long time to go back to sleep.
I constantly feel worried about money and having enough to last while the pandemic is still going on. I worry about my family not having money and falling behind on bills. I worry about the stores not having the essentials for our meals.
I spend most of the day reading and watching the news and worrying about what is going on and what could possibly happen."
479,412483,My wife is a grocery store manager. The quarantine has caused me some stress because she now has to work long overnight shifts due to people panic buying as a result of the quarantine. It's been very hard for me to adjust to this.
480,757088,I have to work remotely from my home. I have two young children and it is highly stressful to juggle work responsibilities and taking care of kids at home.
481,111965,I am scared because so many new cases are growing out of control.
482,117248,"I miss going to the Y for yoga and other exercise classes. I miss going to church for book group, Bible study, and worship services. Grocery shopping is more stressful due to the lack of stock."
483,786970,I am pretty much a homebody and I don't go out very often so in general social distancing hasn't drastically changed my life. But I miss being able to go to my neighborhood bar on the occasions I do want to get out. I am also a little wary when I go to the grocery store because it can be difficult to maintain the 6 foot minimum recommended distance between myself and other in that setting.
484,279722,I just have been going to less places. A lot of places are shut. They only place I have been has basically been the Dollar General and a Farm Market. I bought toilet paper and crackers at Dollar General. I got a pretzel and bananas at the Farmers Market.
485,652456,"It has made me much more suspicious of other people and avoid them much more, even people like my neighbors who I really trust. I have stayed at home for exactly 14 days today, only leaving to get my grocery pick up orders. I have been cooped up with my kids who are now out of school, and trying to learn how to homeschool them as I work at home as well, which is very draining and stressful."
486,122154,I work from home by default so no real change for me
487,438221,"Outside of work or the grocery store, we don't go anywhere. We are stuck in the house all the time. It's getting a little old. Fortunately my work has not been affected by the quarantine."
488,347659,"I am very worried because my husband and I are both older adults, and my husband especially has some chronic conditions. We are trying to stay home except for grocery shopping but even nervous having to go out to do that, and when we do, the stores are out of many things."
489,314457,"The quarantine has not personally affected me at all, I have not left my home at all in the last year and a half, so no change there. The quarantine has affected me due to the shut down of the economy though, my financial state is critical because of this."
490,776260,I have lots of stress and go to the store in a p95v mask and spray all of my groceries down with alcohol. I worry about finanaces and health since my daughter and I are vulnerable.
491,471162,"Yes, I can't see my daughter and my 3 grand-daughters. I actually don't see anyone unless I do grocery shopping."
492,272743,"It hasn't affected me much at all, it's just a matter of remembering to do it."
493,214412,Iâ€™ve made more money.
494,623399,"I am holding sessions with patients by phone, not in person.
I haven't found items at stores due to hoarding.
I am spending most all of my time, when not at work, at home."
495,358713,It is much harder to go to grocery/pharmacy stores and stay the 6 ft distance from people. Also is it has been an inconvenience not having restaurants and the gym open. I worry about my husband who has a compromised immune system due to his medication and worry that I may bring it home to him if I go out anywhere. So I have been staying home. I can no longer go to my job at the college but am glad I am getting paid leave
496,942062,I am going out less.
497,559463,"I have an underlying lung disease, so although the outbreak in my area is just starting, I have reduced my movements greatly in the past two weeks."
498,392873,I am home now and am self quarantining. I canceled a trip
499,132452,

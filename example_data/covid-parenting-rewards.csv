Ironically, all the extra time spent with my children has been wonderful, even if it feels like I can never escape or hire a babysitter to get away for a while. It's neat to see how much my kids play together, how creative they are when their options are stripped down considerably (no playground, public places to play, play dates, etc.).

Because we cannot leave to spend time with our own individual friends, we are finding ways to share the things that bring us joy to one another.

I am learning more about myself as mother, friend, woman.  I have more time to exercise than I ever have before.  I know these things are all coming from a place of privilege, because I have a steady job and income that allows for these things.;"quality time; more time; creativity; personal development";;;

we are getting outside together more. Before we used to do a lot of house projects or cultural things around the city and now we just go to parks and walk around and she really likes it, so that has been a silver lining for us. Also at her age (2.5) we are seeing her language abilities and counting and other skills blossom and it's nice to see it every day. When she was in daycare I think these things would develop without us noticing it right away sometimes.;"being outside; involved in growth/dev; quality time";;;

My nine year old has really struggled emotionally during this time, but she's also shown herself to be a strong leader and amazing, empathetic caretaker. We work very hard to make sure she doesn't feel like she needs to be a leader or caretaker at home, but I think she has found comfort in it and it's been amazing to watch. She's developed a very close bond with her three year old sister, who she used to think was super annoying.

Returning to basics and being content with boredom. I was SO SICK of my kids always asking for things, but I don't think they've asked for anything in weeks. It's been really nice to be separated from the material world. They're playing with rocks and a frisbee and naming squirrels. In the pre-Covid world, they never would have been content with these ""boring"" activities. I love the return to simplicity. In a lot of ways, I dread returning to ""normal.""";"parent-child relationship; closeness; sibling relationship; slowing down";;;

As I said above, we are taking more time to be present for our kids and get to know who they are - what's important to them, what do they enjoy, what thoughts do they have about the present and the future, how do we best support them when they are feeling sad and struggling.  And - as a mother who has always felt ambiguity and uncertainty about blending work and motherhood - there is something about letting go and mostly just being focused on being a mom that also feels rewarding.  So I think I am appreciating that the need to put parenting first is requiring me to step up to that. There's been lots of wishes for snuggles and cuddling at night - my youngest does not want to go to bed alone right now...so we are trying to enjoy that, rather than fighting it.  And they are both managing a lot of change and I am proud and inspired by the ways in which they are navigating this time of uncertainty - it's not always easy and they sometimes get pretty upset about it - but they are also trying hard to understand it and do what's beneficial for our broader community, and think of ways to show appreciation to essential workers, and look out for others through making donations, writing cards, etc.  They try to talk about gratitude and I think we try -as a family - to talk about the difficulty of the situations that many other people (locally and globally) are facing so that we keep perspective as a household.  They participate in that and will often acknowledge the things they are grateful for....so I am appreciating the many ways that they remind me to look for positive aspects of difficult times and to be mindful of the goodness that we have and that we can share.;"gratitude; more time together; quality time; community";;;

Being with my kids all day!  It was a challenge at first (our district had M-F learning--too much (bc we all were dealing with so much: initial fear, so many changes, older and younger friends and family concerns, shortages, no job for me...and juggling it all was a struggle--and we thankfully, weren't a family that lost both jobs, or got sick (knock on wood) or had someone working the frontlines, or were in a single parent home, or an abusive home, or a low-income...etc etc etc, we are fortunate!!, but it was a struggle for us nonetheless and we had a survey and therefore our district went to T-W-R school only!!! Also, much of the online learning was a bit of a learning curve for us all, but now we have it down.  My kids miss socializing, esp my daughter, and my son is highly uncomfortable doing any screen conversations with peers and teachers, so I worry he isn't getting enough peer time. But being with them, I am able to have them do more chores (cook, laundry, clean) and we play board games more.  We have always done puzzles, so that is the same! We also go for many walks still, but they are slower--- the pace has slowed down, and that is a blessing (and I may not have figured that out--bc the work/life balance was a struggle before Covid, and it seems as though the slowing down has been a blessing...I also learned to Skype with my 8o y.o parents and that has helped too!;"quality time; gratitude; slowing down; teaching opportunity; being outside";;;

Before the social isolation started, I felt like we were often running from school to activities and events   Stress has greatly reduced without the hectic rush to everything and the three of us are enjoying more time together.  This amount of non-stop time together will likely not happen again, so I recognize that I need to cherish it.  I get more time to play with them and learn with them.;"more time; flexibility; less stress; quality time; gratitude; learning opportunity";;;
The slow pace of life is addicting - we are getting time together that we don't usually have, so we have time to play, do things around the house, and experience things together in ways we normally wouldn't. We will always remember parts of this fondly, and I hope overall we remember that we did what we could to help the broader situation, built memories and got closer, and worked together to make this all work as well as we reasonably could, while also allowing ourselves to be imperfect.;"slowing down; quality time; new activities; community well-being; making memories; closeness; family resilience";;;

Spending a lot of time with my kiddo. Things like hide-and-seek, or getting down to the ground with him to play with him, or reading lots of books together. I also get to teach my kids math and phonics. He greatly improved his reading and math skills. I cook more meals (no more fast food or take outs), so every meal is a sit down one with nutritious food instead of instant ones. We bake and cook together in the kitchen too, it's lots of fun.;"quality time; more involved in child's education; teaching opportunity; shared meals";;;

Has really increased my feelings that I am a good and capable parent.  We are doing so much better then I expected and my kids are thriving.  Most of my friends who I felt had things more together in regular life are falling apart and the fact that thus far I feel like things are good is really affirming for my parenting abilities.  I also never thought that given my disabilities that I could parent full time so seeing that with limited help from my spouse my kids are ok is also a good feeling.  Being with my kids full time lets me really see who they are and they are awesome little people.;"parenting competence; child resilience; learning opportunity; personal growth";;;

The most rewarding part has been spending more quality time with my kids and husband. I love doing simple activities together, like cooking and yard work. Before Covid19, we were fully engaged in soccer, gymnastics, baseball, work travel and so on. This has allowed us to step off the treadmill for a little bit. This is not to say that the pandemic hasn't been hard and stressful in many other ways. But there are some silver linings for sure.;"quality time; more time; slowing down; gratitude";;;

As frustrated as I have been, my children have handled sheltering in place way better than I ever could have asked for or expected. They definitely have had some frustrations but have truly amazed me with their coping strategies.  The pandemic has brought us closer as a family, not only because of the physically needing to stay home but also because the pace of life has slowed down.  We have gone from being a family who was always on the go and always in a rush to get from one place to the next, to one that has only had to balance virtual learning and family/friend video chats.  I think that is the biggest reward, the slowing down.;"Child Resilience; closeness; more time; slowing down";;;

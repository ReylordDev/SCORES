We had our baby in February right before all of this pandemic got really bad. It has been very hard for our family to not be able to see their grandchild. It makes me so sad that he is missing out on so many of his firsts. This is our first child. Becoming a first time parent to a baby is hard enough. Usually you can have help from your family to watch him while you need rest. We haven't had that at all because we obviously can't. We are doing everything on our own and still managing our daily lives. We are just trying to adjust.;"Isolation; accessing support/service; feeling overwhelmed/exhausted in parenting";"Accessing/utilizing services/social supports; Isolation";"Accessing services and supports; Missed experience and activities; Family separations";"Accessing services and supports; Missed experience and activities; Family separations";;;;;;;

It is difficult to not be able to take your children to a park. It hurts when they don't understand why and you can't explain it. I worry too that if I try to explain too much, I'll scare him and take some of his innocence away (at 4-years-old). I try to keep in perspective parents in other countries such as war zones or food poor areas. I am lucky to still have adequate food, clothing and shelter. It's just difficult to see some of our freedoms, albeit for our own safety, diminished.;Isolation;Isolation;Confinement;Confinement;;;;;;;

Not being able to go to work and having adult time is hard. Work is a break for me to get away from the kids. Now I am daycare, educator, mom, and still have to work. My schedule is now being mom from 8am to 8pm (with virtual work meetings here and there and responding to emails via my phone all day while I parent and educate kids), then actually working from 10pm to 2 or 3am. It is an exhausting schedule. But, there is no leaving the house because of the pandemic, so I cant even go to the local coffee shop for an hour to check emails. When your mom, even when dad is 'on duty' and mom is in the other room working, the kids still want you (i.e.mom). When a child is crying/yelling/laughing in the other room I cannot concentrate on work, and the kids know Im here so they stalk me until I come out of the room. It is not ideal for work, therefore I can only effectively work at night, which makes me tired and irritable during the day, and exhausted.;"Lack of alone time; Juggling multiple roles; isolation; balancing work and parenting; feeling overwhelmed/exhausted in parenting";"Juggling multiple roles; Parenting exhaustion";"No alone time; Balancing work and parenting; Parenting exhaustion";"No alone time; Balancing work and parenting; Parenting exhaustion";;;;;;;

"Our son is constantly there, and I don't like feeling annoyed by that. One of the many reasons I opted to work and not be a stay-at-home parent was because I hated how I was always trying to get a break from my kid during my maternity leave. I *like* missing my son, because it feels good to see him again. Resenting my kid because he's always there, and constantly looking for reasons to get away from him--that doesn't feel great, as a parent.

I'm also just worried that we're not doing enough with my son. Normally he goes to preschool three times per week, has a swim class once per week, and gets to socialize at the park and the library. But now, he's trapped inside with no other kids and he's not really old enough to start new projects or activities by himself. I have to work all the time, and my husband is exhausted by now, so we're not doing all the cute, educational stuff other people seem to be doing all the time.";"parenting exhaution; no alone time; childcare/school closure; isolation/confinement; keeping family/child busy";"No alone time; parent well-being; confinement/isolation; Keeping child/family busy; conflicting parental values and actions";"No alone time; parent well-being; confinement; Keeping child/family busy; conflicting parental values and actions";"Lack of Alone Time; Parent Well-being; Confinement; Keeping Family Busy; Conflicting Parental Values and Actions";;;;;;;

Keeping the kids out of electronics and interested in going for walks, runs, playing games, interacting with family members. My husband and I are in agreement that we shouldn't push the kids too much but now I've had kids that don't want to help much around the house. They are always talking with their friends on the phone which I think it's a good thing, they are always hungry which is overwhelming at times. We are getting lots done for work at home which is incredible but very tiring. My 2 year old has been watching much more TV than usual so I can get work-related things done and I feel guilty. However, whenever my husband and I are outside either relaxing or working on something the kids come and help which is wonderful. We are running out of things to do around to house. It is so challenging to get the 16 and 18 year olds to go to bed before 1:30am. I've made the decision to wake them up around 10:30am regardless.

My six year old son will not listen to or take direction from me or my husband (his dad) anymore. After six weeks of fighting him on doing school work at home, we've decided to stop trying to be his teacher. That's not our role, that's not how he sees us.

Learning at home. I am surprised DPI didn't have more direction for schools. Our school took everything they were going to do with children and put it online. It's a lot of work for them that's traditional in a non-traditional environment. I also worry about my children's learning needs during this time. My youngest is Dyslexic and I am concerned she'll lose progress now that her tutoring has been canceled and isn't getting the support she needs from school. My oldest is ADHD and ASD and hasn't gotten any support from the school. He is in 7th grade and in Milwaukee that is the grade the look at to apply and get into high schools. His grade has gotten so much work, on a new platform, have had to learn how to email and find information about the requirements for the week's assignments through multiple locations including emails to me, emails to him, google classroom, packets, and google drive. This has been considerable harder for a students who are different learners and I fear this will create a wider gap for these students.;"schooling; children well-being ";"schooling; child's well-bieng";;"schooling; child's wellbieng";;;;;;;

The most challenging parts of parenting during the pandemic so far for us have been the overall dramatic and abrupt change of our regular life. The first few weeks were especially difficult and our 10 year old had a lot of questions and really had a hard time processing why this was happening. She began to regress in her bedtime routine to a time when she needed a lot more parent attention (frequently getting out of bed for a drink of water, needing her pillow fluffed, whatnot...) so my long days became even longer. Also Distance Learning is a blessing in that it gives us some structure but a curse in that it requires more of my attention than I anticipated.;"routine changes; explaining covid to kids; parenting exhaustion?; schooling; explaining covid to kids ";"routine changes; explaining covid to kids; child well-being; kids behaviors; schooling; juggling multiple roles";;"routine changes; explaining covid to kids; parenting exhaustion; schooling; child wellbeing; kids behaviors; juggling multiple roles";;;;;;;

Helping the kids understand why we can't go anywhere or see anyone. They're old enough to sort of understand, but it's still hard, especially as the weather becomes nicer.

I am sometimes unsure of how much screentime is too much and have been trying to focus on quality over quantity as they are definitely doing a couple hours a day at this point. I mostly worry about the impact this has on our one year old and that his language development will be delayed. It feels like me and my partner are always cooking and/or thinking about food.

"There has been more sibling conflict in our house and that has been hard.  The emotions of each kid comes out in ways that are perfectly designed to irritate the other one.  One needs to sing it out, the other has sound sensitivity.  Both of our kids have had a bit more anxiety as a part of their lives anyway - so this has intensified that as well.  That has meant it's more of an emotional rollercoaster most days and they seek a lot of mama comfort.  Balancing this with getting a bit of downtime or alone time (as the more ""on"" parent) has been key to meeting this need with grace and compassion.  Our youngest wants to cope with sweets and video games - so there's been more conflict over screen time and our efforts to limit it to what seems healthy.  And on-line school for our youngest has also been very challenging, so there is conflict and some stress around that.  It has been important to do a lot of flexing and readjusting.  And being present.  The hardest part about that - personally - has been letting go of what were the last few months of a year-long sabbatical.  With a partner who has a ""full time"" job to adapt into working from home and two kids in virtual school experiences, someone has to be more present during the day.  So sometimes the main challenge with parenting has just been accepting the feelings of loss and frustration of being unable to still nurture some of the professional aspirations that were easier to tend when there were 7-8 hour school days.   But these are smaller concerns, for sure, than the stress that could be present if we did not have work, or were struggling with resource needs, or had jobs that placed us in health risk situations....so I'm very aware of the relativity here.";"family conflict; children's behavior; no alone time; excessive screentime; schooling; routine changes; balancing work and parenting; work expectations; parent well-being;

The most challenging thing with having a newborn has been not being able to have friends and families members over to even meet our child nor having the ability to rely on their help given we were forced to isolate from nearly everyone. Further, neither myself or my spouse received any kind of parental leave from our jobs and had to instead rely on using up personal and sick leave. Both suddenly being tasked to work from home and also meet the demands of being new parents has prove the most difficult.;"isolation/confinement; family separation; access to supports; balancing work and parenting ";"isolation/confinemnet; family separations; access to supports; balancing work and parenting";;"isolation; family separation; access to supports; balancing work and parenting";;;;;;;

"For my 12 year old it has been making sure he is on top of his school-work.  This is a task that takes a lot of time and if I am not diligent about it daily, it can take me hours to catch up on making sure he is current.  It has also been challenging to me to keep this role as more of a moderator vs a teacher.  I am a substitute teacher but my child does not like me ""teaching"" him.  My other child is 20 with an ID label as well as SPD.  Balancing being available to her along with helping my son and still trying to get work done for my job has proven to be extremely challenging and I have not found the balance yet.";"schooling; balancing parenting and schooling; balancing work and parenting";"schooling; balancing parenting and schooling; balancing work and parenting; child well-being?";;"schooling; balancing parenting and schooling; balancing work and schooling; child wellbeing";;;;;;;

"My mother lives with us to watch my child in lieu of the daycare. She is older and so she doesn't watch her 100% of the time; I take breaks from work (and so does my husband) to chip in. It is stressful having all of us home. Incorporating my mom's views on parenting into my own has been sometimes great and sometimes very annoying. The most challenging thing is that--too many people together all the time, trying to parent together, with different opinions. The next-most challenging is the fact that my daughter is, I think, starting to see us as her ""entertainers"" -- I want her to have more structure and more discipline, but I don't know how to provide it while I am working, and it seems unfair to ask my mom to be the ""bad guy."" Oh, and: The moments when my daughter runs up to me while I am working, smiling and hopeful that I will be able to spend time with her, saying ""Mama!"", and then I have to shoo her away because I am working and staring at a video call. It's heartbreaking -- like doing those occasionally sad daycare drop-offs, except 10 times a day.";"routine changes; family conflict; coparenting conflict; conflicting parenting values and action; balancing work and parenting ";"routine changes; daycare/school closing; family tension; coparenting tension/conflict; conflicting parental values and actions; balancing working and parenting";;"routine changes; childcare school closings; family tension; couple conflict; conflicting parental values and actions; balancign work and parenting";;;;;;;

Working from home while homeschooling has been very difficult. I have carried most of the load related to organizing and setting up the new school work structure at home which leaves me with very little time to get my own work done. I am often overwhelmed. It is difficult to get work done in 'spurts' as some have suggested because my work often takes some time to return to (i.e. logging into the appropriate servers, setting up the workspace, identifying where I left off from the prior work time). My children need a lot of attention and support.;"balancing work and schooling; parenting exhaustion; parent well-being; kids behavior";"balancing work and teaching; parent well-being; kids behavior; parenting exhaustion";;"balancing work and schooling; parenting exhaustion; parent wellbeing; kids behavior";;;;;;;

I think the most challenging parts of parenting are constantly reiterating things and the repetitive nature of trying to teach. Before, I was only able to see my son about 3 hours a day between full time work, part time school and other obligations. Now, I see him twice, if not 3x that a day and it has shown me not only how much I have missed, given me a deeper and greater appreciation for my partner, but also unlocked what feels like a massive amount of guilt I was avoiding because I wasn't present as much as I wanted to be.;"schooling; parenting guilt; routine changes";"schooling; parenting guilt; routine changes";;"schooling; parental guilt; routine changes";;;;;;;
